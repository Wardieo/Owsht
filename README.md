# Flask Web App Deployment Requirements

Hi team,

I've created a basic Flask web app for deployment. Here are the requirements:

- **Runtime**: Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Port**: The app runs on port 5000 by default
- **Storage**: No persistent storage required for now
- **Command to run**: `python app.py`
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt` (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Let me know if you need any additional details!
